# 
The BFlex project is ambitious and has a big goal of replacing Java and C in some projects. Together, let's create this incredible ecosystem and make BFlex a leader in the programming universe.

> [!WARNING]\
> The Project is still under development

# Language
This language was designed with the aim of making low-level programming simpler (removing assembly languages ​​from the low-level category). In it we will have clear inspirations in C, Go, Rust and C++. However, with the aim of making everything simpler, and for this we are creating our own ecosystem that also accepts contact with other ecosystems. BFlex will be a good choice, trust us!


# About 
BFlex is designed for the modern coder who values the flexibility of a bootstraped language. It seamlessly integrates a powerful package manager, reminiscent of Go's modules, yet simplifies the coding experience to empower developers at all levels.

The creation of BFlex wasn't just about building a new language. It was about crafting a tool that could adapt to the ever-evolving challenges of software development, a platform that encourages innovation through its inherent flexibility. It’s a tribute not only to the technical prowess of Ken Thompson but also to his vision of making powerful tools that are accessible and useful to a wide range of people. As powerful as Ken's vision, we are Bflex!

### Why "BFlex"?

In the early days of personal computing, a revolution began in a small, cluttered lab where two visionaries, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, pioneered a language that would forever change the landscape of technology. Their creations, the C programming language and the UNIX operational system, were a marvel of efficiency and simplicity, setting a foundation for future innovations. Decades later, inspired by the spirit of these early computing pioneers, a new language emerges from the shadows of giants — BFlex. Named 'B' in homage to Ken Thompson, who not only co-developed C but later contributed to the creation of Go, BFlex stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, Go and Rust, drawing strength from their robust frameworks and innovative features.

# Why use?
- Multiple platform 
- C-like performance
- Mathematical ease and ease of solving large integers and decimals 
- Compatible with multiple paradigms 
- `Impl`, `Struct` and `Traít`, The Rust power!
- Community in formation, more chances to stand out!


# Developers
### - [Eduardo Bandeira](https://github.com/EngBandeira)・2008
```
Galderio, passionate about C, Asm and LISP, delves into Tensor 
Calculus, Control Theory and Quantum Physics. By joining BFlex,
he becomes one of the main brains behind the language, 
contributing to its development and evolution.

### - [Lucas F. Silveira](https://github.com/lucasFelixSilveira)・2009
```
I started programming at age 8, making scripts for Windows
computers. At 11, I became interested in more advanced levels. 
I decided to start a big project, called LGrow. At 12, I delved 
into low-level programming, refining the project several times. 
Today , with my partner Eduardo Bandeira, we founded BFlex.

# Others 

<h3><details>

- #####  We definitely wasted a lot of time making small talk, and as young people in the prime of their years, a lot of talking about Lucas's cousins. (Beautiful girls)

- ##### If there's something we know how to do, it's argue hard about something silly, but always related to the project. Disagreements, but likes. Nothing more.

- ##### To maintain an organized project, Lucas tries to change school hours from the afternoon to the morning. But his school always gets in his way.
