# BFlex
The BFlex project is ambitious and has a big goal of replacing Java and C in some projects. Together, let's create this incredible ecosystem and make BFlex a leader in the programming universe.

> Warning
> The Project is still under development

# Language
This language was designed with the aim of making low-level programming simpler (removing assembly languages ​​from the low-level category). In it we will have clear inspirations in C, Go, Rust and C++. However, with the aim of making everything simpler, and for this we are creating our own ecosystem that also accepts contact with other ecosystems. BFlex will be a good choice, trust us!


# About 
The project is simple but complex, an idea so easy on paper and difficult to execute... The project was fragmented into 2 stages, Initial Compiler and Final Compiler. The initial compiler is written in C, the final one will be written in BFlex. This will allow our project to be tested by ourselves at creation time. With this we will provide you with the best possible experience with BFlex and our multi-platform executable. We hope to see you again using our ecosystem! 💜
