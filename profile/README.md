# 
The BFlex project is ambitious and has a big goal of replacing Java and C in some projects. Together, let's create this incredible ecosystem and make BFlex a leader in the programming universe.

> [!WARNING]\
> The Project is still under development

# Language
This language was designed with the aim of making low-level programming simpler (removing assembly languages ​​from the low-level category). In it we will have clear inspirations in C, Go, Rust and C++. However, with the aim of making everything simpler, and for this we are creating our own ecosystem that also accepts contact with other ecosystems. BFlex will be a good choice, trust us!


# About 
BFlex is designed for the modern coder who values the flexibility of a bootstraped language. It seamlessly integrates a powerful package manager, reminiscent of Go's modules, yet simplifies the coding experience to empower developers at all levels.

The creation of BFlex wasn't just about building a new language. It was about crafting a tool that could adapt to the ever-evolving challenges of software development, a platform that encourages innovation through its inherent flexibility. It’s a tribute not only to the technical prowess of Ken Thompson but also to his vision of making powerful tools that are accessible and useful to a wide range of people. As powerful as Ken's vision, we are Bflex!

### Why BFlex?

In the early days of personal computing, a revolution began in a small, cluttered lab where two visionaries, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, pioneered a language that would forever change the landscape of technology. Their creations, the C programming language and the UNIX operational system, were a marvel of efficiency and simplicity, setting a foundation for future innovations. Decades later, inspired by the spirit of these early computing pioneers, a new language emerges from the shadows of giants — BFlex. Named 'B' in homage to Ken Thompson, who not only co-developed C but later contributed to the creation of Go, BFlex stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, Go and Rust, drawing strength from their robust frameworks and innovative features.

# Developers
### - [Eduardo Bandeira](https://github.com/EngBandeira)・2008
```
Galderio, passionate about C, Asm and LISP, delves into Tensor 
Calculus, Control Theory and Quantum Physics. By joining BFlex,
he becomes one of the main brains behind the language, 
contributing to its development and evolution.
```
- PR / BR;
- ASM, C, C++, Java, Lisp;
### - [Lucas F. Silveira](https://github.com/lucasFelixSilveira)・2009
```
I started programming at age 8, making scripts for Windows
computers. At 11, I became interested in more advanced levels. 
I decided to start a big project, called LGrow. At 12, I delved 
into low-level programming, refining the project several times. 
Today , with my partner Eduardo Bandeira, we founded BFlex

# Special quotes
### - [Renato Fermi](https://github.com/repiazza)・1988
```
Proud father, devoted educator for life. System Architect, 
C language specialist; Deep experienced on retail and 
wholesale. Gaming and training new programmer generation 
since 2018

# Curious

- We definitely wasted a lot of time making small talk, and as young people in the prime of their years, a lot of talking about Lucas's cousins. (Beautiful girls)

- If there's something we know how to do, it's argue hard about something silly, but always related to the project. Disagreements, but likes.

- Lucas definitely doesn't like studying what he won't use, he prefers practice. Eduardo, on the other hand, is much more theoretical, he delves into all the areas he wants, even if he doesn't use some things.

- Whenever we get tired and need a break, the first thing we do is talk about girls.

- To maintain an organized project, Lucas tries to change school hours from the afternoon to the morning. But his school always gets in his way.

- Tired of seeing Python or JavaScript programmers spread across the world, we decided to create the language.

- Definitely, a city in the interior of Minas Gerais is not good. Lucas notices this fatefully every day.

- Lucas in a city of 11,200 inhabitants, and Eduardo in one with 20,000 inhabitants, it was certainly unexpected that they could come together and create something as big as BFlex.

- BFlex had a few names previously, one of them being "LGrow", where the name persisted for a long time.
